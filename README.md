# guessing_game
 This is my first project in python. 
 The project contains the code for a console game in python lenguage. 
 When run it, people is asked to submit a number between 1 and 10. 
 The code comprares it with a random number and tells the player if this number is lower or higher than the random one. 
 Once the player guesses the number the game is over.
